registry-config-info-4=namespace: The namespace on zookeepers, all the information is stored under the namespace.
registry-config-info-5=max-retries: The number of retries to connect to the registry.
registry-config-info-6=base-sleep-time-milliseconds: Retry interval.
registry-config-info-7=max-sleep-time-milliseconds: Maximum retry time.
registry-config-info-8=session-timeout-milliseconds: The timeout of the client talk with registration centers.
registry-config-info-9=digest:The password to connect the registration center.



protocol-config-title=Protocol configuration (eagle: protocol)
protocol-config-info-1=name: Protocol name, currently only supports eagle.
protocol-config-info-2=serialization: Serialization, support hessian, kryo, protobuf.
protocol-config-info-3=heartbeat-factory: Heartbeat factory, the default is eagle, through the spi way you can customize the heartbeat factory.
protocol-config-info-4=select-thread-size: The number of server processing i/o threads, try not to block these io threads.
